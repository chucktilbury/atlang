Development notes. This helps me remember what I have done and why.

Chapter 17.
I have the calculator completely working, except for a couple of bugs.
* Moved all of the data storage for the running program into the VM.

Chapter 18.
* Adding values for bool and nil.
* Adding boolean expressions.

Chapter 19.
* Adding strings.
* Disable automatic casting of strings. This will be added later as an
    explicit cast.
